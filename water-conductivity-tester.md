## Whatâ€™s In My Water? Make Your Own Water Tester

In this activity, you will build a circuit to measure how well different water samples conduct electricity.

When some substances are dissolved in water, their molecules break apart into ions. Ions are atoms or molecules with a positive or negative charge: they either have an extra electron, or a missing electron. Because of their charges, these ions move around and allow electrical current to flow through the water.

Scientists use conductivity as one quick way to test water quality. If they know something is dissolved in a water sample, they can use other sensors to find out more.

### Make the Water Tester
1. Peel away a small amount of the paper backing from a piece of copper tape. Stick the copper tape over the markings on the template, peeling the paper away as you go. Cut the tape when you reach the end of each marking on the template.
1. Stick down your LED, pointing the same direction as the template shows.
1. Fold down the battery holder flap.
1. Add two stacked batteries, + side up. Clip them inside the battery holder flap with the binder clip.
1. Your probe is ready! Use it to check the water samples. The brighter the LED, the more conductive the water sample.

Make sure to rinse your probe in distilled water and dry it off between samples.


### Record Results
Record your results by marking the brightness you observe:

Distilled water:               off --------------------------------------------------------- very bright

Salt water:                      off --------------------------------------------------------- very bright

Sugar water:                   off --------------------------------------------------------- very bright

Tap water from ____:     off --------------------------------------------------------- very bright

Tap water from ____:     off --------------------------------------------------------- very bright

Creek water from ____: off --------------------------------------------------------- very bright

Mystery water sample:  off --------------------------------------------------------- very bright


You can also use your water probe to measure if water has reached a certain height, or to test soil moisture.
